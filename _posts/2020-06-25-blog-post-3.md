>I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) in early morning with a hint of AMS. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow; then I saw this landscape, mind blown. I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to the Everest Base Camp (June, 2, 2016).

When I landed Tribhuvan International Airport, I had to apply for the arrival visa. It was a simple process: you enter information into one of the computers and line up with passport, fee, and the receipt from the computer, mingling with the excited travelers from around the world. Once I got out of the airport, tour company boys from all over the town were waving at the fresh tourists to lure them into their hotel. I met Giri and Maskey here who took me to the guesthouse that they were working for in Thamel.

Next morning, I visited Nepal Tourism Board to get my trekking permit in Khumbu area. I originally thought to take a group Jeep to Jiri and start walking from there. Walking a few extra days was not an issue, but the guys at Pariwar warned that there will be leeches literally raining onto my head since it was in the middle of raining season. So I simply gave up on that Jeep option and decided to take the flight to Lukla. I really can't ...leeches...:(. 

I booked the cheapest and earliest ticket next day, which I waited 6 hours in the airport just to get announced that the flight was cancelled and delayed to the next morning because the visibility was not good in Lukla. In fact, we almost took off: the bus transferred all passengers from the lounge to the plane, luggages got into the cargo, and we fought for the best seats - as there was no seat assigned on the ticket. First of all, I was not happy because I have to wake up early again, and second, I could not understand why the visibility was a problem when the sky was clear in Kathmandu?! While panicking, I found Flora and Fernando, a Chilean-Spanish couple who stayed at Pariwar (we said hello on the rooftop), who were as frustrated as I was. We shared a taxi and returned to Pariwar, reuniting with our boys.

>...it did not take long to realize a day of delay was in fact quite lucky as the waiting for the return flight was pretty bad... 

(May 27, 2016) Next morning, we could see a nice blue sky and our flight took off no problem next day. The small plane - perhaps carrying about 15 of us - cruised between mountains and we could see the Himalayas in distance, covered in snow. About 3.5 hours later, we safely landed on Lukla, the world's most dangerous airport. Flora and Fernando hired a guide so they left soon after we had a cup of tea (Sunny Garden Restaurant and Cafe, 80 rupees). (8:00 AM) I was on my own, fully excited, there was only one route moving away from the airport. It was hard to get lost. I passed a permit checkpoint and I walked, walked, and walked. I could see the Floras walking far ahead of me. Who needs a guide, when there are twenty trekkers in sight, all going up to EBC?! I had a bowl of noodle soup in a small town called Phakding (11:43 AM) and called a day in Chhumowa Sonam Lodge at 3 PM. Chhumowa Sonam Lodge was owned and ran by a Sherpa family. When I entered the lodge, they were confused if I am a trekker or Sherpa. We really looked similar. It only costed two dollars to stay a night, but I kind of had to order a meal which is more expensive than the bed. I tried Daal Bhat, a traditional Nepali meal (I wrote on my journal "Dal-Bhat was so so, but I liked it because it was all-you-can-eat rice. Rice is important." Not sure what I was thinking, but apparently happy). I was only 2760m high, but it was a freezing night.

(May 28, 2016) I left the lodge at 8:49 AM. I paid 700 rupees: 200 for the bed, 400 for the Daal Bhat, and 50 x 2 for milk tea. My goal was Namche Bazaar. Namche is the main trading center and hub for the Khumbu region that has post office, restaurants, a bank and even a beauty Salon. I was particularly excited about that I might be able to see Tibetans in person! It is unfortunate that we cannot travel Tibet freely. I arrived to Jorsale and had a quick bite. It was only 10 AM and I was not very hungry, but the sign saying "The last restaurant before Namche" made me feel like I am obligated to have something here. I met almost everybody who were in the same flight in this restaurant. Flora and Fernando, Kyle from Seattle living in Bangkok, Jeff and Malory from the U.S., and a group of Japanese trekkers. When I finished the Sherpa soup, it was raining outside. The road to Namche was relatively well paved but rough, steep, endless, slippery, and kind of the route you would never want to climb again. I finally checked it Namche Hotel Kamal by around 3 PM, where I ran into Flora and Fernando.

(May 29, 2016) I spent two nights in Namche to adapt the elevation. I had a mild headache on the first night but I was not sure if it was from the altitude or the exhaustion. I immediately passed out as I got my bed but woke up around midnight and had trouble to getting back to sleep. At dawn, streets vendor began to open, the majority were selling used mountain gears, but some were selling real gems like hand-crafted necklace with Om-Mani-Padme-Hum written in Tibetan on one side and the Buddah eye on the other. I appreciated the old man carving this and bought two with no bargaining. I decided to leave some of my luggage in Namche. The weight of my luggage was proportional to my greed, and I was far from being free. I needed to decide what to keep and what to leave behind and it was a difficult task.

(May 30, 2016) I tied my shoelaces early and saw Flora and Fernando waiting for me on the first floor. They offered me to trek together and I was very happy that I got a company! We left Namche at 7:30 AM and headed to Tengboche. Since Namche is at 3440 meters and Tengboche is 3867 meters high, it is only 427 meters uphill today so an easy day must be waiting for us - and how ignorant this expectation was! The route was flat until Khumbu Junction, where the single route split into two, one leading to Gokyo and the other to EBC. To get to Tengboche, we needed to cross a deep valley, and we could see Tengboche far ahead in the middle of the next mountain. At 12:30 PM, we got to the bottom of the valley. Flora got sick here, due to exhaustion, altitude sickness or may be some bad food in Namche, and we began to seriously consider hiring the helicopter back to Kathmandu! She recovered in about an hour, and we began to trek the endless uphill for two hours. We arrived to Tengboche at 3:12 PM, densely covered with clouds. I found a few bags of ramen noodles that Korean expedition team left in the kitchen and had a nice spicy hot meal in a long time. Prices for a meal increased in proportion to the distance from Lukla because somebody had to carry it all the way. Being able to get what you want was a privilege.

(May 31, 2016) I head to the Tengboche gompa just to see their Buddhist service. No photograph was allowed but it was a medium-sized room with a large Buddha statue, the walls were painted with Buddhist art, and there were about seven monks chanting Om-Mani-Padme-Hum. It literally mean 'the jewel in the lotus' and it is a chant to invoke a female deity named AvalokiteÅ›vara, but Tibetan Buddhists believe uttering this incantation will bring miracles for them. It is still hard to understand what it actually means and what drives their belief, but it was something. We had a short trek only to Dingboche (4260 miters) which ended at 1:13 PM, but it was continuous uphill, covered in clouds. I finally took a hot shower in Dingboche. There was an electric boiler that seemed malfunctioning so the hot water was just released from the water tank heated by sun for the whole day - no cold water option available. Hot shower costed more than the bed. In fact, one of the biggest lessons from my trip was: being able to have a nice hot shower must not be taken for granted - tap water freezes in winter in China; bucket shower is common in most rural Asia; and you must shower with ice codl glacier water in Northern Pakistan. Warm shower is a privilege. I reiterate, every time I shower. I cut my hair for no reason in Dingboche also. 

(June 1, 2016) I had another free day to adapt the elevation. I felt altitude sickness when I woke up with bad headache. I took the pill and soon got okay. I visited the nearest peak (4700 m) to facilitate acclimatization. I was very tired today. But I had difficulty sleeping this night.

>  I missed some people and many things. But I was not really sure where to go, which still is a frustrating question for me. I was lonely and my future seemed hopeless.
