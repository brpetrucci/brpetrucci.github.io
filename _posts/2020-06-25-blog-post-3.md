I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) this morning with a hint of AMS. I had garlic soup for breakfast and filled my bottle with hot ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow then I saw this mind blowing landscape. I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to the Everest Base Camp (June, 2018).
