On day 10, I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) in early morning with a hint of AMS. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow; then I saw this landscape, mind blown. I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to the Everest Base Camp (June, 2018).

When I landed Tribhuvan International Airport, I had to apply for the arrival visa. It was a simple process: you enter information into one of the computers and line up with passport, fee, and the receipt from the computer, mingling with the excited travelers from around the world. Once I got out of the airport, tour company boys from all over the town were waving at the fresh tourists to lure them into their hotel. I met Giri and Maskey here who took me to the guesthouse that they were working for in Thamel.

Next morning, I visited Nepal Tourism Board to get my trekking permit in Khumbu area. I originally thought to take a group Jeep to Jiri and start walking from there. Walking a few extra days was not an issue, but the guys at Pariwar warned that there will be leeches literally raining onto my head since it was in the middle of raining season. So I simply gave up on that Jeep option and decided to take the flight to Lukla. I really can't ...leeches...:(. 

I booked the cheapest and earliest ticket next day, which I waited 6 hours in the airport just to get announced that the flight was cancelled and delayed to the next morning because the visibility was not good in Lukla. In fact, we almost took off: the bus transferred all passengers from the lounge to the plane, luggages got into the cargo, and we fought for the best seats - as there was no seat assigned on the ticket. First of all, I was not happy because I have to wake up early again, and second, I could not understand why the visibility was a problem when the sky was clear in Kathmandu?! While panicking, I found Flora and Fernando, a Chilean-Spanish couple who stayed at Pariwar (we said hello on the rooftop), who were as frustrated as I was. We shared a taxi and returned to Pariwar, reuniting with our boys.

...but it did not take long to realize a day of delay was in fact quite lucky as the waiting for the return flight was pretty bad... 

Next morning, we could see a nice blue sky and our flight took off no problem next day. The small plane - perhaps carrying about 15 passengers - cruised between mountains and we could see the Himalayas in distance, covered in snow. About 3.5 hours later, we safely landed on Lukla, the world's most dangerous airport.
