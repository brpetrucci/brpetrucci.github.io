I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) this morning with a hint of AMS. I filled my bottle with hot ginger tea and I told myself that I am going down tomorrow then I saw this landscape, mindbloing. It has been about ten days so far and I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to the Everest Base Camp (June, 2018).
