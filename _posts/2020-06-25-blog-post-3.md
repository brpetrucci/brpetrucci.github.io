>I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) with a hint of altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea from the lodge. I told myself that I am quitting tomorrow; Every step was an excruciating pain so I sat on the ground and looked back where I walked - stunning! I guess I will climb a bit more. On my way to Everest Base Camp (EBC).

Namaste!

I landed Tribhuvan International Airport late at night. Getting the arrival visa was straightforward: you submit the information into one of the computers and line up with the excited travelers from around the world. At the main entrance of the airport, boys from every tour companies in the town were waving at the fresh tourists to lure them into their hotel. Giri and Maskey caught me. I checked into the guesthouse that they were working for, Pariwar guesthouse in Thamel, Kathmandu.

I walked to Nepal Tourism Board office to get the permit to trek in Khumbu region. I planned to take a bus to Jiri to start my trek. It would take a few extra days to reach Lukla, where the trek to EBC officially begins, but I quickly changed my mind and instead took a flight to Lukla. Time and energy were not my constraints but the guys in Pariwar warned me that there will be leeches literally raining onto my head since we were in the middle of raining season. I really can't ...leeches...!

Despite my ticket was for the earliest one, I waited for six hours in the airport before the flight got delayed until the next morning. Actually, we almost took off; the airport bus transported us from the lounge to the plane, the luggages made into the cargo, and we fought for the best seats since no seats were assigned. I was upset because I had to wake up early again but more importantly, I could not understand why low visibility in Lukla was a problem when the sky was clear in Kathmandu?! However, it did not take long to realize a day of delay was quite lucky as the waiting for the return flight was pretty bad. While panicking, I met Flora and Fernando, a Chilean-Spanish couple who also stayed at Pariwar. We shared a taxi back to Thamel.

Next morning, sky as clear, as firm-looking, as blue marble greeted us and the journey from Thamel to Lukla was seamless. The small plane, perhaps carrying about fifteen of us, cruised through mountains, like the opening scene of [the Jurassic Park](https://youtu.be/ghKy8FRhs28), with the snow covered Himalayas at distance. About three-and-a-half hour later, we safely landed on the world's most dangerous airport, Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla. Flora and Fernando hired a guide and they began the trek after we had a cup of tea together. At 8:00 AM, I was on my own. The well-paved trail was hard to miss. I called a day in Manjo and checked into [Chhumowa Sonam Lodge](https://goo.gl/maps/9pAQZBAETJwPW8h26). The Sherpa lady at the lodge seemed puzzled when I entered the lodge if I was a trekker or one of them. We really looked alike. In fact, many trekkers asked me for direction saying 'namaste' with their hands pressed together. I sort of enjoyed being treated as local. The night on 2760 meters was freezing.

I left the lodge at 8:49 AM next morning. My goal today was Namche Bazaar that particularly interested me because I might be able to see the real Tibetans. I was eager to visit Lhasa, Tibet but free traveling for foreigners were prohibited due to political reasons unless a Chinese 'guide' was accompanied. So Namche was where I could get as close to Tibet, without sacrificing my freedom. I ate in Jorsale at 10 AM even though I was not hungry because the sign said "the last restaurant before Namche" and I felt I was obligated to eat here - marketing! When I finished the Sherpa soup, it was drizzling outside. The road to Namche was rough, steep, slippery, endless, the kind of trail I would never want to climb again. I finally checked into Namche Hotel Kamal, where Flora and Fernando were also staying.

> I met Pradip in the Sonam lodge. Pradip said he was happy because he is a Rai, the Nepali social class that has broader life opportunities compared to the Sherpa people. He has been traveling in Khumbu region with his friend to explore the Himalayas. 

I spent two nights in Namche to adapt the elevation. I had mild headache in the first night but was not sure if it was from the altitude or exhaustion, or both. The majority of street vendors were selling second hand mountain gears, but some were selling real gems like hand-crafted necklaces with Om-Mani-Padme-Hum written in Tibetan on one side and the Buddah's eye on the other. I watched an old man carving this necklace and bought two of the fresh ones with no bargaining. I decided to leave some of my luggages in Namche. The weight of my luggage was proportional to my greed and I was far from being free. Deciding what to keep and what to leave behind was a difficult task.

Flora and Fernando offered me to trek together while I was tying my shoelaces. I was very happy that I got a company! We left Namche at 7:30 AM and headed to Tengboche. Tengboche was only 427 meters higher than Namche, so I naively expected an easy day! The trail until Khumbu Junction was fairly flat, however, the deep valley between the junction and Tengboche awaited us. At 12:30 PM, we got to the bottom of the valley and Flora got sick due to exhaustion, altitude sickness or may be some bad food in Namche. We began to seriously consider hiring helicopter back to Kathmandu. She recovered in about an hour and we continued the endless climbing for two hours. Tengboche was densely covered in clouds. The lodge I stayed in Tengboche because has a few bags of Shin-ramen noodles that Korean expedition team left a while ago. I was pleasantly surprised.

> Every store en route had the pronoun, 'the world's highest'; the world's highest bakery, lodge, teahouse... and even toilet!

I headed to the Tengboche gompa at dawn to see the Buddhist service. No photographs were allowed but I recall Buddhist paintings surrounded the wall and seven or so monks were chanting 'Om-Mani-Padme-Hum'. This phrase can be literally translated as 'the jewel in the lotus' with which repeated chanting will invoke a female deity named AvalokiteÅ›vara. Tibetan people believe uttering this incantation will bring them miracles. It is still hard to understand what drives their strong belief, but only amazed me. We had a relatively short trek to Dingboche (4260 meters) but it was continuous uphill covered in mist. In Dingboche, I finally paid to take a hot shower. There was an electric boiler in the shower but it seemed to be malfunctioning as the hot water was just released from the water tank on the rooftop, heated by the sun and no cold water option was available. One of the biggest lessons from my trip was that nice warm shower is a real luxury, cold bucket shower was common in most rural Asia; tap water pipe froze in winter in rural China; and you must shower with glacier water in northern Pakistan; I reiterate every time I shower. 

I had another free day to adapt the elevation in Dingboche. I had altitude sickness with bad headache on the second day. I visited the nearest peak (4700 m) to facilitate acclimatization. I was very tired today but I had difficulty sleeping this night.

>  I was yearning for something but I did not know what and how to resolve the longing. I felt like I have been stepping on invisible steps in the midst of blackness. I was lonely and my future seemed hopeless. I was not sure where to go next, which still is a frustrating question for me. 

I left Dingboche with a hint of altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea from the lodge. I told myself that I am quitting this tomorrow; I could not see any reason to go further. I mean, what would all this struggling to make to EBC change anything?! Within an hour of leaving the lodge, I was already about a kilometer or two behind Flora and Fernando. I planned to tell them I am going down next time I catch them. Every step was an excruciating pain so I sat on the ground and looked back where I walked - stunning! I guess I will climb a bit more. Two Sherpa boys who were behind me, delivering a case to the next town, smiled at me and asked if everything was okay. I was embarrassed. I finally caught Flora and Fernando in Dughla where we had a tea beside the furiously flowing glacier stream. Then we climbed another painful hill and I lied and shrunk by body on the ground like a caterpillar in the middle. The top of this hill was frighteningly silent. It was cemetery of those who passed away while challenging the Everest. We arrived in Lobuche at 1:30 PM where we called a day. My face got darker as I get closer to the sun. I was the mountain man!

> Many adventurers were buried here. It was hard to imagine if their deaths were tragedious or honorable. 

I left most of my luggage in Lobuche. Before leaving Kathmandu, the boys at Pariwar suggested me to leave my stuff in the guesthouse. The foolish myself thought that it was their strategy to force me to stay with them upon return. In mountain, my backpack was stuffed with nothing but junks and now I was stupidly suffering to carry those junks to one of the highest places one can reach. We walked for about four hours of unpaved route covered with large sharp rocks, with wild yaks on the right and the melting glacier holes on the other side. EBC was just around the corner.

> Watching glacier melting and breaking was surreal. No one knew how deep these holes were but it must be freezing in there.

We checked into the the only open lodge in Gorak Shep and had a bite before heading to EBC. The cost of food got impressively expensive and peanut butter and jelly sandwich was the only reasonably affordable food for me. THRILLED. We have encountered a group of Australian trekkers returning from EBC, whose faces were filled with the joy of accomplishment. EBC was nothing but a bunch of rocks stacked on top of another wrapped with the prayer flags. There was no one greeting us for the achievement, no certificate nothing. However, we shouted, hugged each other, and celebrated with a can of San Miguel beer that Fernando brought. Short of oxygen in the high altitude made us hard to breathe. We were afraid of getting sick from putting alcohol into our body so we only took photo pretending to be drinking. We watched the tip of Mountain Everest at distance that was firmly standing as if it was telling us that we have not conquered any of it yet. We returned to Gorak Shep by around 4 PM. The lounge was filled with happy comrades who won the battle. We got a new American friend Kyle, who had a drill-sergeant guide by the way, and we played Flora's original card game until late night. Excited to go back down tomorrow.

Short of oxygen kept me awake almost all night. At dawn, we geared up to climb Kala Patthar (5664.5 meters). Despite I was supposed to have the most accessible view of Everest, I could not identify which one it was. Every peak looked all same to me - they were equally overwhelming - but who cares now. We descended for the next three days. We spend a night in Pangboche, then Jorsale, before finally arrived in Lukla. At the same time, I collected by luggage and restuffed in the backpack as I got closer to the reality. It rained during the last few miles before Lukla. An old Sherpa lady was blowing whistle to keep her yaks on the track which shepherded me as well.

I neither hired a guide nor porter partly because I was short on budget but more importantly, I felt sorry for them to carry my burden. It felt like I was being irresponsible and selling my pain to someone else. I was shortsighted. The small amount of money the porters made provided them opportunities: opportunities to eat and stay warm, educate their children, and expand their businesses. Young porters gained experience so they can be a guide later on. My few dollars could have enriched their lives. My wisdom was in its infancy and I may never get mature. I paid Flora and Fernando's guide the full amount for taking me together. He said it is okay, probably because I was not 'officially' guided but kind of followed them, but I gave him anyway. I decided to go to a hot country next so I do not have to worry about hot shower anymore, so I gave him my jacket and scarf, too (good intension, but I kind of needed it again later on).

Lukla was surprisingly crowded. Frustrated trekkers said no flights were coming in during the past four days due to low visibility... AGAIN! In the little fancy donut shop on the main road, I could overhear someone saying that he already missed their flight back to the U.S., someone talking with her travel agency and the insurance company to check if hiring helicopter can be covered (it was about 500 dollars per person and 2500 for charter), someone wheedling naive travelers to walk together to Jiri to get a jeep back to Kathmandu, and the American monk disagreeing with that idea due to the infestation of leeches (I totally agreed!).

When it was not raining, we enviously watched helicopters taking off carrying either rich or desperate travelers. The flight ticket office was always filled with a guides who were trying to get tickets for their clients. On the third day of being stuck, local people said tomorrow should be the day. Soon, Flora and Fernando excitedly told me that they got the ticket for the next day. Mr. Guide promised me that he will get me a cheap ticket, but I have not seem him past two days! I ran into the ticket booth, battled with the guides and I won my seat in TARA airlines. The printer in the office was broken so the agent literally hand-wrote the ticket on the spot, suspicious. Next morning, cheers from here and there in Lukla woke me up. I opened the curtain and it was a clear day and I joined the shouts for joy. We are going back!

> Flora, Fernando, and the our guide who taught us the Nepali tongue twister: "No one can do in Kathmandu, only cat can do."

Every moment in Khumbu is one of the most challenging yet the most precious memories. Many years have passed yet some of us are still in touch and we miss those times. I fortunately seen some of them in person, but for the most, only by facebook - all are working hard to conquer their own Everest in their life. Back in Kathmandu, we checked into Pariwar again. I watched Flora and Fernando getting their luggages back with a complex mind. First, I had a hot shower then had some Chinese food and donuts and slept. We had many beers and had a nice Daal-Baht lunch. We also lured Kyle to change his guesthouse to ours and we chat on the rooftop until late. We appreciated every moment.
