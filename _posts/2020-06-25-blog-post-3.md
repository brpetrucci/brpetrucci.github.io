I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) this morning with a hint of AMS. I had garlic soup for breakfast and filled my bottle with hot ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow then I saw this mind blowing landscape. I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to the Everest Base Camp (June, 2018).

When I landed Tribhuvan International Airport, I had to apply for the arrival visa. I believe the visa on arrival is required for the most tourists except for those from India. It is a simple process: you input information on the computer screen and line up on a line with passport, fee, and the receipt from the computer. There were full of boys from the tour companies waiting for the fresh tourists outside of the airport, I met Giri and Maskey here, and they took me to the hotel they work for, Pariwar guesthouse in Thamel, Kathmandu. Actually, I was supposed to meet my British couchsurfing host but I could not get in touch with him. He said he was asleep, like two weeks later. Oh well.

I chose Pariwar because I had no other choice. It was already dark out and I had no idea where I was. But it was a pleasant experience. After I checked it, Giri and Tajan (another staff in the guesthouse) talked me into purchasing their Annapruna Base Camp (ABC) trek package with a Helicopter return. I said these look nice, but I cannot afford it. I also wanted to tackle the Everest Base Camp (EBC), not ABC. I asked how much would it be to visit EBC without a guide and porter, and they laughed. 

Next morning,
