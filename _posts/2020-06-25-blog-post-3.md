On day 10, I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) in early morning with a hint of AMS. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow; then I saw this landscape, mind blown. I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to the Everest Base Camp (June, 2018).

When I landed Tribhuvan International Airport, I had to apply for the arrival visa. It was a simple process: you enter information into one of the computers and line up on with passport, fee, and the receipt from the computer along with the excited trekkers from all over the world. Once I got out of the airport, the boys from tour companies all over the Kathmandu were waving at the fresh tourists to lure them into their hotel. I met Giri and Maskey here who took me to the guesthouse they worked for, Pariwar guesthouse in Thamel, Kathmandu. 

Next morning, I visited Nepal Tourism Board to get my permit to trek in Khumbu Area. I originally thought to take a group Jeep to Jiri and start walking from there. Walking a few extra days was not a problem, but the guys at Pariwar warned that there will be leeches literally raining onto my head since it as in the middle of raining season. So I simply gave up that Jeep option and decided to take the flight to Lukla. I really can't leeches... sorry:( I bought the earliest ticket next day, because it was the cheapest. Next morning, we waited 6 hours just to get announced that our flight was cancelled and delayed to the next morning because the visibility was not good in Lukla. First, I was not happy because I have to wake up early again, and second, I could not understand why the visibility was a problem when the sky was clear in Kathmandu. ...but I realized a day of delay was quite lucky as the waiting for the flight back to Kathmandu was pretty bad...
