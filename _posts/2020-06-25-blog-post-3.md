 On my way to the Everest Base Camp, a few miles from [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) (June, 2018).

I left Dingboche this morning with a hint of AMS. I had my garlic soup for breakfast and filled my bottle with hot ginger tea before I said good-byes to the Sherpa guys at the teahouse. I was telling myself that I am definitely going down tomorrow. My feet continued to ache so I sat down on a rock and looked back. Then I saw this landscape, mindblowing. It has been about ten days so far and I guess I am going up a bit more.
