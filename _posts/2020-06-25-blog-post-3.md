>I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) in the early morning with a hint of altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea from the lodge. I told myself that I am quitting this tomorrow; then I looked behind - stunning! I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to Everest Base Camp (EBC).

I landed Tribhuvan International Airport late at night and I had to apply for the arrival visa. It was a simple process: you enter the information into one of the computers and line up with the excited travelers from around the world. At the main entrance of the airport, boys from all over the tour companies in town were waving at the fresh tourists to lure them into their hotel. I met Giri and Maskey who took me to the guesthouse that they were working for in Thamel, Pariwar guesthouse.

Next morning, I walked to Nepal Tourism Board to get my trekking permit in Khumbu region. I originally thought to take a bus to Jiri to start the trek. It would take a few extra days to reach Lukla, where the trek to EBC officially begins, but I instead took a flight to Lukla. Time or energy were not my constraints, but the guys at Pariwar warned me that there will be leeches literally raining onto my head since we were in the middle of raining season. I really can't ...leeches...:(

I booked the earliest ticket for the next day. Unfortunately, I ended up waiting for 6 hours in the airport just to get announced that my flight got delayed to the next morning because the visibility was not good in Lukla. Actually, we almost took off - the bus transferred us from the airport lounge to the plane, we saw our luggages getting into the cargo, and we also fought for the best seats as no seat was assigned. First of all, I was upset because I have to wake up early again, but second, I could not understand why the visibility was a problem when the sky was clear in Kathmandu?! While panicking, I met Flora and Fernando, a Chilean-Spanish couple who also stayed at Pariwar and who were as frustrated as I was. We shared a taxi back to Pariwar. I felt better to have someone to complain together.

>...it did not take long to realize a day of delay was in fact quite lucky as the waiting for the return flight was pretty bad... 

(May 27, 2016) Next morning, we could see a nice blue sky and our flight took off no problem next day. The small plane - perhaps carrying about 15 of us - cruised between mountains and we could see the Himalayas in distance, covered in snow. About 3.5 hours later, we safely landed on Lukla, the world's most dangerous airport. Flora and Fernando hired a guide so they left soon after we had a cup of tea (Sunny Garden Restaurant and Cafe, 80 rupees). (8:00 AM) I was on my own, fully excited, there was only one route moving away from the airport. It was hard to get lost. I passed a permit checkpoint and I walked, walked, and walked. I could see the Floras walking far ahead of me. Who needs a guide, when there are twenty trekkers in sight, all going up to EBC?! I had a bowl of noodle soup in a small town called Phakding (11:43 AM) and called a day in Chhumowa Sonam Lodge at 3 PM. Chhumowa Sonam Lodge was owned and ran by a Sherpa family. When I entered the lodge, they were confused if I am a trekker or Sherpa. We really looked similar. It only costed two dollars to stay a night, but I kind of had to order a meal which is more expensive than the bed. I tried Daal Bhat, a traditional Nepali meal (I wrote on my journal "Dal-Bhat was so so, but I liked it because it was all-you-can-eat rice. Rice is important." Not sure what I was thinking, but apparently happy). I was only 2760m high, but it was a freezing night.

(May 28, 2016) I left the lodge at 8:49 AM. I paid 700 rupees: 200 for the bed, 400 for the Daal Bhat, and 50 x 2 for milk tea. My goal was Namche Bazaar. Namche is the main trading center and hub for the Khumbu region that has post office, restaurants, a bank and even a beauty Salon. I was particularly excited about that I might be able to see Tibetans in person! It is unfortunate that we cannot travel Tibet freely. I arrived to Jorsale and had a quick bite. It was only 10 AM and I was not very hungry, but the sign saying "The last restaurant before Namche" made me feel like I am obligated to have something here. I met almost everybody who were in the same flight in this restaurant. Flora and Fernando, Kyle from Seattle living in Bangkok, Jeff and Malory from the U.S., and a group of Japanese trekkers. When I finished the Sherpa soup, it was raining outside. The road to Namche was relatively well paved but rough, steep, endless, slippery, and kind of the route you would never want to climb again. I finally checked it Namche Hotel Kamal by around 3 PM, where I ran into Flora and Fernando.

(May 29, 2016) I spent two nights in Namche to adapt the elevation. I had a mild headache on the first night but I was not sure if it was from the altitude or the exhaustion. I immediately passed out as I got my bed but woke up around midnight and had trouble to getting back to sleep. At dawn, streets vendor began to open, the majority were selling used mountain gears, but some were selling real gems like hand-crafted necklace with Om-Mani-Padme-Hum written in Tibetan on one side and the Buddah eye on the other. I appreciated the old man carving this and bought two with no bargaining. I decided to leave some of my luggage in Namche. The weight of my luggage was proportional to my greed, and I was far from being free. I needed to decide what to keep and what to leave behind and it was a difficult task.

(May 30, 2016) I tied my shoelaces early and saw Flora and Fernando waiting for me on the first floor. They offered me to trek together and I was very happy that I got a company! We left Namche at 7:30 AM and headed to Tengboche. Since Namche is at 3440 meters and Tengboche is 3867 meters high, it is only 427 meters uphill today so an easy day must be waiting for us - and how ignorant this expectation was! The route was flat until Khumbu Junction, where the single route split into two, one leading to Gokyo and the other to EBC. To get to Tengboche, we needed to cross a deep valley, and we could see Tengboche far ahead in the middle of the next mountain. At 12:30 PM, we got to the bottom of the valley. Flora got sick here, due to exhaustion, altitude sickness or may be some bad food in Namche, and we began to seriously consider hiring the helicopter back to Kathmandu! She recovered in about an hour, and we began to trek the endless uphill for two hours. We arrived to Tengboche at 3:12 PM, densely covered with clouds. I found a few bags of ramen noodles that Korean expedition team left in the kitchen and had a nice spicy hot meal in a long time. Prices for a meal increased in proportion to the distance from Lukla because somebody had to carry it all the way. Being able to get what you want was a privilege.

(May 31, 2016) I headed to the Tengboche gompa just to see their Buddhist service. No photograph was allowed but it was a medium-sized room with a large Buddha statue, the walls were painted with Buddhist art, and there were about seven monks chanting Om-Mani-Padme-Hum. It literally mean 'the jewel in the lotus' and it is a chant to invoke a female deity named AvalokiteÅ›vara, but Tibetan Buddhists believe uttering this incantation will bring miracles for them. It is still hard to understand what it actually means and what drives their belief, but it was something. We had a short trek only to Dingboche (4260 miters) which ended at 1:13 PM, but it was continuous uphill, covered in clouds. I finally took a hot shower in Dingboche. There was an electric boiler that seemed malfunctioning so the hot water was just released from the water tank heated by sun for the whole day - no cold water option available. Hot shower costed more than the bed. In fact, one of the biggest lessons from my trip was: being able to have a nice hot shower must not be taken for granted - tap water freezes in winter in China; bucket shower is common in most rural Asia; and you must shower with ice codl glacier water in Northern Pakistan. Warm shower is a privilege. I reiterate, every time I shower. I cut my hair for no reason in Dingboche also. 

(June 1, 2016) I had another free day to adapt the elevation. I felt altitude sickness when I woke up with bad headache. I took the pill and soon got okay. I visited the nearest peak (4700 m) to facilitate acclimatization. I was very tired today but I had difficulty sleeping this night.

>  I yearned some people and many things but I did not know how to resolve the longing. I felt like I have been stepping on invisible steps in the midst of the blackness. I was lonely and my future seemed hopeless. I was not sure where to go next, which still is a frustrating question for me. 

(June 2, 2016) I left Dingboche in the morning early with a hint of the altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow. I could not see a reason to go further, I mean, what would reaching the EBC make anything different? I was about a kilometers or two behind Flora and Fernando, and I planned to tell them I am going down once I catch them. My feet ached and I sat on the ground and looked back where I walked. What a stunning view it was. I could see Dingboche at the bottom of the valley surrounded by sharp peaks covered in snow, glacier river, and the blue sky. Two Sherpa boys were behind me, delivering something to even more remote town. I was embarrassed. I was enjoying the luxury of whining. I finally caught Flora in Dughla.  We had a tea listening to the glacier stream flowing furiously.  We had to climb a huge hill, and this was very hard. On the top was a frighteningly silent cemetery where bodies of those who challenged the Everest. We finally reached Lobuche at 1:30 PM where we called a day. I looked at mirror and my face was all tanned!

(June 3, 2016) Finally, the EBC was our destination today! We left Lobuche at 8 AM where I left most of my luggage. My luggage has been a burden. The boys at Pariwar recommended to leave my stuff at the guesthouse and I thought that was just their strategy to force me to stay with them upon return. I realized that I have been carrying junks on my back during the entire trip, perhaps all my life, suffering unnecessarily. Why could not I let things go? Nevertheless, giving up my possession had been very difficult. We walked 4 hours of unpaved route covered with large sharp rocks, with wild yaks and mountain goats on the right and the melting glacier holes on the left.

We checked into the only open lodge in Gorak Shep and had a bit before heading to the EBC. The cost of food got impressively high and peanut butter and jelly sandwich was the only reasonably affordable food for me. Excited. We have met a group of Australian trekkers who we saw at the airport - perhaps they took the next plane from Kathmandu - whose faces were filled with joy of accomplishment. When we finally got to the EBC, that only had bunch of rocks with some prayer flags, we hugged each other and unofficially celebrated with a can of San Miguel beer that Fernando brought. Lack of oxygen in the high altitude made us hard to breathe. We were all afraid of getting sick from putting alcohol into our body so we only took photo pretending to be drinking it. The EBC was silent. No one to greet us for our days of trek, no certificate or anything. The Mount Everest in distance were standing as if to threat us that we have not conquered anything. We returned to Gorak Shep around 4 PM. The lounge was filled with comrades who conquered this monster together. We played card game until late night. Excited to go back down tomorrow.

(June 4--6, 2016) Lack of oxygen kept me awake almost all night, and at 4 AM there were other trekkers having difficulty to sleep in the lounge. We left the lodge at 5 AM to visit Kala Patthar (5664.5 meters; 'black rock' in Hindi), Despite it was the hill where you can get the most accessible closeup view of Everest, I could not identify which one. The snow mountains looked all same to me. For the three days I descended where I had suffered for the past week. I rested where I rested on the way up and met the herd of yaks that probably I saw on the way up - but the perception was the opposite. The forests with trees meant I still have long way to go when I was climbing, but it meant I am almost done now. We spend a night in Pangboche, Jorsale, before finally reaching to Lukla. At the same time, I collected by luggage in Lobuche and Namche. The weight of my backpack was telling me as it it was time to get back to the reality. It rained for the last few miles before Lukla. An old lady Sherpa who was shepherding the yaks was blowing whistle. She shepherded me, too.

I hired neither a guide nor porter partly because I was short on budget but I also felt sorry for someone to carry my burden for me, particularly when we could not communicate fully. That was not the best choice though. Being able to carry someone's backpack for money provided opportunities for the Sherpas - they could buy food, afford their kids to go to school, and advertise their businesses. I was fortunate that I met Flora and Fernando. Besides the fact that they are one of the few most awesome people I have ever met, being alone in the middle of nowhere made me to reiterate my past and to worry about the future, pushing me into the valley of frustration and loneliness. We laughed, talked, and learnt about our lives in the Everest. I miss them a lot.

(June 6--9, 2016) Lukla was surprisingly full. It was unexpected because I did not see so many people coming down - may be they took different routes. They said there had been no flight for the past few days due to the weather conditions. There was a little fancy donut shop in Lukla and I could overhear someone saying that they already missed their flight back to the U.S. in Kathmadu, someone talking with their travel agency and the insurance company to check if the Helicopter hire can be covered (it was 500 dollars per person), someone proposing others to walk together to Jiri to get a bus back, and some disagreeing with that due to the infestation of leeches (I totally agreed!). Compare to them, I was lucky. 

When I returned to Lukla, the flight ticket booth was full of guides who were trying to change their clients' ticket. I did not go in because I was too exhausted to fight that crowd. I enviously watched a series of helicopters leaving with either rich or desperate trekkers. Two days later, Flora and Fernando told me excitedly that they got the ticket for the next morning. The forecast was sounding, I ran to the TARA airline company and battled with the Sherpas. I said I want the first ticket tomorrow and the agent said it is full. He said second flight is still available, and I got that one. The agent literally hand-wrote the ticket on the spot. Suspicious!

Last day in Lukla, I woke up with cheers from the Colombian trekkers in next door and I cheered with them as soon as I opened the curtain. It was a clear day!
