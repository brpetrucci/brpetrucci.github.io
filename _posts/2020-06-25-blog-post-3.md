>I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) with a hint of altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea from the lodge. I told myself that I am quitting this tomorrow; then I looked behind - stunning! I guess I will climb a bit more. On my way to Everest Base Camp (EBC).

I landed Tribhuvan International Airport late at night. Getting the arrival visa was simple: you enter the information into one of the computers and line up with the excited travelers from around the world. At the main entrance of the airport, boys from every tour companies in the town were waving at the fresh tourists to lure them into their hotel. Giri and Maskey caught me and took me to the guesthouse in Thamel that they were working for, Pariwar guesthouse.

Next morning, I walked to Nepal Tourism Board to get my trekking permit in Khumbu region. I originally thought to take a bus to Jiri to start my trek. It would take a few extra days to reach Lukla, where the trek to EBC officially begins, but I quickly changed my mind and took a flight to Lukla instead. Time and energy were not my constraints, but the guys at Pariwar warned me that there will be leeches literally raining onto my head since we were in the middle of raining season. I really can't ...leeches...!

Despite I had the ticket for the first flight, I waited for six hours in the airport before got notified for the delay until the next morning due to low visibility in Lukla. Actually, we almost took off - the airport bus transferred us from the lounge to the plane, the luggages made into the cargo, and we fought for the best seats since no seats were assigned. I was upset because I had to wake up early again and I could not understand why the visibility was a problem when the sky was clear in Kathmandu?! While panicking, I met Flora and Fernando, a Chilean-Spanish couple who also stayed at Pariwar. We shared a taxi back to Thamel.

>...it did not take long to realize a day of delay was in fact quite lucky as the waiting for the return flight was pretty bad... 

Next morning, nice blue sky greeted us and the route from Thamel to Lukla was seamless. The small plane - perhaps carrying about fifteen of us - cruised between mountains (reminded me of [the Jurassic Park](https://youtu.be/ghKy8FRhs28)!) with the snow covered Himalayas in distance. About 3.5 hours later, we safely landed on the world's most dangerous airport. Flora and Fernando hired a guide and they began the journey soon after we had a cup of tea (Sunny Garden Restaurant and Cafe, 80 rupees). At 8:00 AM, I was on my own, fully excited, and well-paved single route was hard to miss. See? You need no guide when there are twenty trekkers in sight?! I called a day in [Chhumowa Sonam Lodge](https://goo.gl/maps/9pAQZBAETJwPW8h26) in Manjo at 3 PM. The lodge was ran by a Sherpa family and when I entered the lodge, they were confused if I was a trekker or one of them. We really looked similar. In fact, many trekkers asked me for direction saying 'Namaste' with closed hands. When I answered they complemented my English. I tried to explain in the first few times that I was also a trekker, but I eventually gave up, kind of enjoying being treated as local. The night on 2760 meters was freezing. .

I left the Sonam lodge at 8:49 AM. My goal for the day was Namche. I was particularly excited about Namche because I might be able to see the real Tibetans in person! Lhasa is one of the places that I really wish to visit. I looked for options in Nepal but free travels were prohibited due to political reasons unless hiring a Chinese 'guide'. I ate in Jorsale at 10 AM even though I was not very hungry because the sign said "The last restaurant before Namche" and I felt I was obligated to eat here. When I finished the Sherpa soup, it was raining outside. The road to Namche was rough, steep, slippery, and endless, the kind of the route I would never want to climb again. I finally checked into Namche Hotel Kamal by around 3 PM, where Flora and Fernando were also staying.

> I met Pradip in the Sonam lodge. Pradip said he was happy because he was a Rai, the Nepali social class that has broader opportunity than Sherpa people. He was traveling in Khumbu region with his friend to explore the Himalayas. 

I spent two nights in Namche to adapt the elevation. I had a mild headache in the first night but I was not sure if it was from the altitude or exhaustion. At dawn, streets vendors began to open; the majority were selling second hand mountain gears, but some were selling real gems like hand-crafted necklaces with Om-Mani-Padme-Hum written in Tibetan on one side and the Buddah's eye on the other. I appreciated the old man carving this necklace and immediately bought two with no bargaining. I decided to leave some of my luggage in Namche. I realized the weight of my luggage was proportional to my greed and I was far from being free. I needed to decide what to keep and what to leave behind which was a difficult task.

Flora and Fernando offered me to trek together while I was tying my shoelaces. I was very happy that I got a company! We left Namche at 7:30 AM and headed to Tengboche. Tengboche was only 427 meters higher than Namche, so I was expecting for an easy day! The flat trail until Khumbu Junction was fine, then there was a deep valley between the junction and Tengboche. At 12:30 PM, we got to the bottom of the valley where Flora got sick due to exhaustion, altitude sickness or may be some bad food in Namche, and we began to consider hiring the helicopter back to Kathmandu seriously! She recovered about an hour later and we began to trek the endless uphill for two more hours. Tengboche was densely covered in clouds. I particularly have a good memory in Tengboche because I found a few bags of Shin-ramen noodles that Korean expedition team left in the kitchen. Being able to get what you enjoy is a privilege.

> Every store en route had the pronoun 'the world's highest'. The world's highest bakery, lodge, teahouse... and even toilet!

I headed to the Tengboche gompa at dawn to see the Buddhist service. No photographs were allowed but I recall Buddhist paintings covered the wall and about seven monks were chanting 'Om-Mani-Padme-Hum' that literally means 'the jewel in the lotus' with which chanted to invoke a female deity named AvalokiteÅ›vara. Tibetan people believe uttering this incantation will bring them miracles. It is still hard to understand what drives their strong belief, but it is only amazing. We had a relatively short trek to Dingboche (4260 meters) but it was continuous uphill covered in mists. I finally paid to take a hot shower in Dingboche. There was an electric boiler in the shower but it seemed malfunctioning as the hot water was just released from the water tank heated by sun for the whole day - no cold water option was available. One of the biggest lessons from my trip was that nice warm shower is a real luxury - cold bucket shower is common in most rural Asia; tap water freezes in winter in China; and you must shower with glacier water in northern Pakistan - warm shower is a privilege. I reiterate, every time I shower. 

I had another free day to adapt the elevation in Dingboche. I had altitude sickness with bad headache in the second day. But I took a pill and got okay. I visited the nearest peak (4700 m) to facilitate acclimatization. I was very tired today but I had difficulty sleeping this night.

>  I yearned for something but I did not know what and how to resolve the longing. I felt like I have been stepping on invisible steps in the midst of blackness. I was lonely and my future seemed hopeless. I was not sure where to go next which still is a frustrating question for me. 

I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) with a hint of altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea from the lodge. I told myself that I am quitting this tomorrow; I could not see a reason to go further, I mean, what would making to EBC change anything?! I was about a kilometer or two behind Flora and Fernando, and I planned to tell them I am going down once I catch them. My feet ached and I sat on the ground and looked back - stunning! I guess I will climb a bit more. Two Sherpa boys were behind me, delivering a case to even more remote town. I should not be my whining. I finally caught Flora and Fernando in Dughla where we had a tea listening to the glacier stream flowing furiously. Then we had to climb the painful hill that  was very hard and I lied on the ground like a little caterpillar. It was a frighteningly silent. In fact, it was a cemetery of those who passed away while challenging the Everest. We finally got to Lobuche at 1:30 PM and we called a day. My face was all tanned! I was the mountain man!

> Many adventurers were buried here. It was hard to identify if their deaths were tragedies or honors. 

I left most of my luggage in Lobuche. Before leaving Kathmandu, the boys at Pariwar suggested me to leave my stuff at the guesthouse. The foolish myself thought that it was their strategy to force me to stay with them upon return. My backpack was stuffed with nothing but junks and now I was suffering to carry those junks to one of the highest places one can reach. We walked for about four hours of unpaved route covered with large sharp rocks, with wild yaks on the right and the melting glacier holes on the other side.

> Watching glacier melting was surreal. No one knew how deep these were but it must be freezing in there.

We checked into the the lodge in Gorak Shep and had a bite before heading to EBC. The cost of food got impressively expensive and the peanut butter and jelly sandwich was the only reasonably affordable food for me. THRILLED. We have encountered a group of Australian trekkers who were returning from EBC whose faces were filled with the joy of accomplishment. When we finally got to EBC that had bunch of rocks stacked on top of another wrapped with the prayer flags, we hugged each other and celebrated with a can of San Miguel beer that Fernando brought. Short of oxygen in the high altitude made us hard to breathe. We were afraid of getting sick from putting alcohol into our body so we only took photo pretending to be drinking it. The base campt was silent, more than the cemetery. There was no one to greet us for the achievement, no certificate or anything. We watched the tip of Mountain Everest in distance that was firmly standing as if it was telling us that we have not conquered any of it. We returned to Gorak Shep by around 4 PM. The lounge was filled with comrades who conquered the giant together. We got a new American friend Kyle and we played Flora's original card game until late night. Excited to go back down tomorrow.

Short of oxygen kept me awake almost all night. At dawn, we geared up to climb Kala Patthar (5664.5 meters; 'black rock' in Hindi). Despite I was supposed to have the most accessible view of Everest, I could not identify which one it was. The peak now looked all same to me - they were equally overwhelming. We descended for the next three days.  While the scenery was identical, the perception was the opposite. We spend a night in Pangboche, then Jorsale, before finally reaching to Lukla. At the same time, I collected by luggage in Lobuche and Namche. The restuffed backpack was telling me as if it was time to get back to the reality. It rained during the last few miles before Lukla. An old Sherpa lady was blowing whistle to keep her yaks on the track, and she shepherded me, too.

I neither hired a guide nor porter partly because I was short on budget but more importantly, I felt sorry for them to carry my burden instead of me. It felt like I was paying someone to suffer for me. I was wrong. For the porters, the money they received by carrying someone's luggage provided opportunities - they could buy food, afford their children's tuition, and advertise their businesses. Young porters gained experience so they can be a guide later on. My few dollars could enrich their lives.

I was fortunate that I met Flora and Fernando. Besides the fact that they are one of the few most precious people I have ever met, being alone in the middle of nowhere made me to reiterate my past and to worry about the future, pushing me into the valley of frustration and loneliness. Together we laughed, talked, and heard about each other's lives. I miss them a lot. 

Lukla was surprisingly full. Frustrated trekkers said they had been stuck here fore the past four days because no flights were available due to low visibility... again! In the little fancy donut shop on the main road, I could overhear someone saying that he already missed their flight back to the U.S., someone talking with her travel agency and the insurance company to check if hiring helicopter can be covered (it was about 500 dollars per person), someone wheedling naive travelers to walk together to Jiri to get a jeep back to Kathmandu as well, as the others disagreeing with that idea due to the infestation of leeches (I totally agreed!).

We enviously watched helicopters taking off with either rich of desperate trekkers. There was one flight ticket booth that was always filled with guides who were trying to get the tickets for their clients. On the third day in Lukla, Flora and Fernando excitedly said they got the ticket for the next day. I checked the forecast and was supposed to be clear the next day. I ran into the ticket booth, battled with the guides and I won the ticket from TARA airline. The printer was not working so the agent literally wrote my ticket on the spot. Next morning, I woke up with the cheers here and there around Lukla. I opened the curtain and I joined the shouts for joy. I am going back!

> Flora, Fernando, and the our guide who taught us the Nepali tongue twister: "No one can do in Kathmandu, only cat can do."

Back in Kathmandu, we checked into Pariwar again. I watched Flora and Fernando picking their luggages back with a complex mind. First, I had a hot shower then had some Chinese food. We had many beers and had a nice Daal-Baht and lured Kyle to change his guesthouse to ours. We chat on the rooftop until late in shorts and flip-flops. We appreciated every moment.
