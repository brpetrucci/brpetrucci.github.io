Day 10, I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) in early morning with a hint of AMS. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow; then I saw this landscape, mind blown. I guess I am going up a bit more. On my way to the Everest Base Camp (June, 2018).

When I landed Tribhuvan International Airport, I had to apply for the arrival visa. It was a simple process: you enter information into one of the computers and line up on with passport, fee, and the receipt from the computer along with the excited trekkers from all over the world. Once I got out of the airport, it was full of boys from tour companies waving at the fresh tourists, I met Giri and Maskey here who took me to the hotel they work for, Pariwar guesthouse in Thamel, Kathmandu. Actually, I was supposed to meet my British couchsurfing host but I could not get in touch with him. He said he was asleep, like two weeks later. Oh well.
