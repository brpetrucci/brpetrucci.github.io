>I left [Dingboche](https://goo.gl/maps/VJhhDz9UqBezfTvD9) with a hint of altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea from the lodge. I told myself that I am quitting this tomorrow; then I looked behind - stunning! I guess I will climb a bit more. On my way to Everest Base Camp (EBC).

I landed Tribhuvan International Airport late at night. Getting the arrival visa was simple: you enter the information into one of the computers and line up with the excited travelers from around the world. At the main entrance of the airport, boys from every tour companies in the town were waving at the fresh tourists to lure them into their hotel. Giri and Maskey caught me and took me to the guesthouse in Thamel that they were working for, Pariwar guesthouse.

Next morning, I walked to Nepal Tourism Board to get my trekking permit in Khumbu region. I originally thought to take a bus to Jiri to start my trek. It would take a few extra days to reach Lukla, where the trek to EBC officially begins, but I quickly changed my mind and took a flight to Lukla instead. Time and energy were not my constraints, but the guys at Pariwar warned me that there will be leeches literally raining onto my head since we were in the middle of raining season. I really can't ...leeches...!

Despite I had the ticket for the first flight, I waited for six hours in the airport before got notified for the delay until the next morning due to low visibility in Lukla. Actually, we almost took off - the airport bus transferred us from the lounge to the plane, the luggages made into the cargo, and we fought for the best seats since no seats were assigned. I was upset because I had to wake up early again and I could not understand why the visibility was a problem when the sky was clear in Kathmandu?! While panicking, I met Flora and Fernando, a Chilean-Spanish couple who also stayed at Pariwar. We shared a taxi back to Thamel.

>...it did not take long to realize a day of delay was in fact quite lucky as the waiting for the return flight was pretty bad... 

Next morning, nice blue sky greeted us and the route from Thamel to Lukla was seamless. The small plane - perhaps carrying about fifteen of us - cruised between mountains (reminded me of [the Jurassic Park](https://youtu.be/ghKy8FRhs28)!) with the snow covered Himalayas in distance. About 3.5 hours later, we safely landed on the world's most dangerous airport. Flora and Fernando hired a guide and they began the journey soon after we had a cup of tea (Sunny Garden Restaurant and Cafe, 80 rupees). At 8:00 AM, I was on my own, fully excited, and well-paved single route was hard to miss. See? You need no guide when there are twenty trekkers in sight?! I called a day in [Chhumowa Sonam Lodge](https://goo.gl/maps/9pAQZBAETJwPW8h26) in Manjo at 3 PM. The lodge was ran by a Sherpa family and when I entered the lodge, they were confused if I was a trekker or one of them. We really looked similar. In fact, many trekkers asked me for direction saying 'Namaste' with closed hands. When I answered they complemented my English. I tried to explain in the first few times that I was also a trekker, but I eventually gave up, kind of enjoying being treated as local. The night on 2760 meters was freezing. .

I left the Sonam lodge at 8:49 AM. My goal for the day was Namche. I was particularly excited about Namche because I might be able to see the real Tibetans in person! Lhasa is one of the places that I really wish to visit. I looked for options in Nepal but free travels were prohibited due to political reasons unless hiring a Chinese 'guide'. I ate in Jorsale at 10 AM even though I was not very hungry because the sign said "The last restaurant before Namche" and I felt I was obligated to eat here. When I finished the Sherpa soup, it was raining outside. The road to Namche was rough, steep, slippery, and endless, the kind of the route I would never want to climb again. I finally checked into Namche Hotel Kamal by around 3 PM, where Flora and Fernando were also staying.

> Pradip said he is a Rai, the Nepali social class that has broader opportunity than Sherpa people. He was traveling  in Khumbu region with his friend to explore the Himalayas. 

I spent two nights in Namche to adapt the elevation. I had a mild headache in the first night but I was not sure if it was from the altitude or exhaustion. At dawn, streets vendors began to open; the majority were selling second hand mountain gears, but some were selling real gems like hand-crafted necklaces with Om-Mani-Padme-Hum written in Tibetan on one side and the Buddah's eye on the other. I appreciated the old man carving this necklace and immediately bought two with no bargaining. I decided to leave some of my luggage in Namche. I realized the weight of my luggage was proportional to my greed and I was far from being free. I needed to decide what to keep and what to leave behind which was a difficult task.

Flora and Fernando offered me to trek together while I was tying my shoelaces. I was very happy that I got a company! We left Namche at 7:30 AM and headed to Tengboche. Tengboche was only 427 meters higher than Namche, so I was expecting for an easy day! The flat trail until Khumbu Junction was fine, then there was a deep valley between the junction and Tengboche. At 12:30 PM, we got to the bottom of the valley where Flora got sick due to exhaustion, altitude sickness or may be some bad food in Namche, and we began to consider hiring the helicopter back to Kathmandu seriously! She recovered about an hour later and we began to trek the endless uphill for two more hours. Tengboche was densely covered in clouds. I particularly have a good memory in Tengboche because I found a few bags of Shin-ramen noodles that Korean expedition team left in the kitchen. Being able to get what you enjoy is a privilege.

> Every store on the route had the pronoun, 'the world highest'. The world's highest bakery, lodge, teahouse... even toilet!

I headed to the Tengboche gompa at dawn to see the Buddhist service. No photographs were allowed but I recall Buddhist paintings covered the wall and about seven monks were chanting 'Om-Mani-Padme-Hum' that literally means 'the jewel in the lotus' with which chanted to invoke a female deity named AvalokiteÅ›vara. Tibetan people believe uttering this incantation will bring them miracles. It is still hard to understand what drives their strong belief, but it is only amazing. We had a relatively short trek to Dingboche (4260 meters) but it was continuous uphill covered in mists. I finally paid to take a hot shower in Dingboche. There was an electric boiler in the shower but it seemed malfunctioning as the hot water was just released from the water tank heated by sun for the whole day - no cold water option was available. One of the biggest lessons from my trip was that nice warm shower is a real luxury - cold bucket shower is common in most rural Asia; tap water freezes in winter in China; and you must shower with glacier water in Northern Pakistan - warm shower is a privilege. I reiterate, every time I shower. 

I had another free day to adapt the elevation in Dingboche. I had altitude sickness with bad headache in the second day. But I took a pill and got okay. I visited the nearest peak (4700 m) to facilitate acclimatization. I was very tired today but I had difficulty sleeping this night.

>  I yearned for something but I did not know what and how to resolve the longing. I felt like I have been stepping on invisible steps in the midst of the blackness. I was lonely and my future seemed hopeless. I was not sure where to go next, which still is a frustrating question for me. 

(June 2, 2016) I left Dingboche in the morning early with a hint of the altitude sickness. I had a bowl of garlic soup and filled my bottle with warm ginger tea. I told myself that I am going down tomorrow. I could not see a reason to go further, I mean, what would reaching the EBC make anything different? I was about a kilometers or two behind Flora and Fernando, and I planned to tell them I am going down once I catch them. My feet ached and I sat on the ground and looked back where I walked. What a stunning view it was. I could see Dingboche at the bottom of the valley surrounded by sharp peaks covered in snow, glacier river, and the blue sky. Two Sherpa boys were behind me, delivering something to even more remote town. I was embarrassed. I was enjoying the luxury of whining. I finally caught Flora in Dughla.  We had a tea listening to the glacier stream flowing furiously.  We had to climb a huge hill, and this was very hard. On the top was a frighteningly silent cemetery where bodies of those who challenged the Everest. We finally reached Lobuche at 1:30 PM where we called a day. I looked at mirror and my face was all tanned!

> Many adventurers were buried here. It was hard to imagine their last moment in the middle of the peak that are closest to the sky - I guess it could be either tragedy or an honor. 

(June 3, 2016) Finally, the EBC was our destination today! We left Lobuche at 8 AM where I left most of my luggage. My luggage has been a burden. The boys at Pariwar recommended to leave my stuff at the guesthouse and I thought that was just their strategy to force me to stay with them upon return. I realized that I have been carrying junks on my back during the entire trip, perhaps all my life, suffering unnecessarily. Why could not I let things go? Nevertheless, giving up my possession had been very difficult. We walked 4 hours of unpaved route covered with large sharp rocks, with wild yaks and mountain goats on the right and the melting glacier holes on the left.

> Watching the glacier potholes was surreal. No one knew how deep these holes were but I was sure it must be freezing in there.

We checked into the only open lodge in Gorak Shep and had a bit before heading to the EBC. The cost of food got impressively high and peanut butter and jelly sandwich was the only reasonably affordable food for me. Excited. We have met a group of Australian trekkers who we saw at the airport - perhaps they took the next plane from Kathmandu - whose faces were filled with joy of accomplishment. When we finally got to the EBC, that only had bunch of rocks with some prayer flags, we hugged each other and unofficially celebrated with a can of San Miguel beer that Fernando brought. Lack of oxygen in the high altitude made us hard to breathe. We were all afraid of getting sick from putting alcohol into our body so we only took photo pretending to be drinking it. The EBC was silent. No one to greet us for our days of trek, no certificate or anything. The Mount Everest in distance were standing as if to threat us that we have not conquered anything. We returned to Gorak Shep around 4 PM. The lounge was filled with comrades who conquered this monster together. We played card game until late night. Excited to go back down tomorrow.

> Smiling but not smiling.

(June 4--6, 2016) Lack of oxygen kept me awake almost all night, and at 4 AM there were other trekkers having difficulty to sleep in the lounge. We left the lodge at 5 AM to visit Kala Patthar (5664.5 meters; 'black rock' in Hindi), Despite it was the hill where you can get the most accessible closeup view of Everest, I could not identify which one. The snow mountains looked all same to me. For the three days I descended where I had suffered for the past week. I rested where I rested on the way up and met the herd of yaks that probably I saw on the way up - but the perception was the opposite. The forests with trees meant I still have long way to go when I was climbing, but it meant I am almost done now. We spend a night in Pangboche, Jorsale, before finally reaching to Lukla. At the same time, I collected by luggage in Lobuche and Namche. The weight of my backpack was telling me as it it was time to get back to the reality. It rained for the last few miles before Lukla. An old lady Sherpa who was shepherding the yaks was blowing whistle. She shepherded me, too.

I hired neither a guide nor porter partly because I was short on budget but I also felt sorry for someone to carry my burden for me, particularly when we could not communicate fully. That was not the best choice though. Being able to carry someone's backpack for money provided opportunities for the Sherpas - they could buy food, afford their kids to go to school, and advertise their businesses. I was fortunate that I met Flora and Fernando. Besides the fact that they are one of the few most awesome people I have ever met, being alone in the middle of nowhere made me to reiterate my past and to worry about the future, pushing me into the valley of frustration and loneliness. We laughed, talked, and learnt about our lives in the Everest. I miss them a lot.

> Flora, Fernando, and the Mr. guide who taught me the Nepali tongue twister rhyme: "No one can do in Kathmandu, only cat can do."

(June 6--9, 2016) Lukla was surprisingly full. It was unexpected because I did not see so many people coming down - may be they took different routes. They said there had been no flight for the past few days due to the weather conditions. There was a little fancy donut shop in Lukla and I could overhear someone saying that they already missed their flight back to the U.S. in Kathmadu, someone talking with their travel agency and the insurance company to check if the Helicopter hire can be covered (it was 500 dollars per person), someone proposing others to walk together to Jiri to get a bus back, and some disagreeing with that due to the infestation of leeches (I totally agreed!). Compare to them, I was lucky. 

When I returned to Lukla, the flight ticket booth was full of guides who were trying to change their clients' ticket. I did not go in because I was too exhausted to fight that crowd. I enviously watched a series of helicopters leaving with either rich or desperate trekkers. Two days later, Flora and Fernando told me excitedly that they got the ticket for the next morning. The forecast was sounding, I ran to the TARA airline company and battled with the Sherpas. I said I want the first ticket tomorrow and the agent said it is full. He said second flight is still available, and I got that one. The agent literally hand-wrote the ticket on the spot. Suspicious!

Last day in Lukla, I woke up with cheers from the Colombian trekkers in next door and I cheered with them as soon as I opened the curtain. It was a clear day!
