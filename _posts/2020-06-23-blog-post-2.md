I rented a motorbike for a week for $7 per day and drove from Mandalay to Old Bagan just to see Kyawkyaw and Papa. I found them selling postcards surrounded by a bunch of European tourists in front of Ananda Temple. I asked them what they want for lunch and they said chicken. I got a box of chocolates for Julaemon, a dress for Papa, and a few dollars for Kyawkyaw. I spent all my money with them so unexpectedly had some adventure to exchange my Korean won to kyat to pay my gas - because apparently no bank preferred Korean won. I promised them that I will come back. On the way back to Mandalay from Bagan, [near Myingyan local animal market](https://goo.gl/maps/QLafEiSzY5xecfb16) (Feb, 2018).
