On the way back to Mandalay from Bagan, [near Myingyan local animal market](https://goo.gl/maps/QLafEiSzY5xecfb16) (Feb, 2018)

I visited Myanmar twice, in 2016 for the first time and again in 2018. Myanmar is one of my favorite countries from all of the countried I visited and I have met so many beautiful souls and gifted the most precious memories from them.
