## What is Academic Network

My master's advisor used to introduced me to his colleagues as his academic *son*. That was a sort of comforting feeling because I felt like I was not alone in this academic universe as a science infant. But this is not always the most wonderful thing because in some countries, such academic relationship plays too much role in the hiring process, making the selection process unfair for those who does not belong to such *lineages*. 

In my first year of Ph.D., I had an assignment that is to trace my academic ancestry -- something that illustrates scientists and scholars according to mentoring relationships, often in the form of doctoral supervision relationships. I assumed an *academic genealogy* was supposed to be like a pedigree (Academic *genealogy* sounds so misleading, though). But it was obvious that the tree model will be inadequate once the mentorship involves more than a single advisor.



## Data collection

I used two sources to get the ancestral data. First, I used [**the Academic Family Tree**](https://academictree.org). This website had a lot of information but of course a lot of information that I was particularly looking for was missing. Interestingly, recent information was more likely to be missing compared to the older dataset. This probably reflects how the number of doctors increased tremendously in the recent years. I had to google some names, find their CVs, find their interview transcripts and so on. Starting from a few generations upward, the names that I was looking for started to appear in the Academic Family Tree website. In some cases, I used [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), mainly to confirm what was presented in the Academic Family Tree website when really interesting names appears, like Jerzy Neyman, Andrey Markov, or *Jesus Christ*.


## Visualizing data using d3.js

[**D3**](https://d3js.org) stands for Data-Driven Documents that helps to visualize (preferably) large data using HTML, SVG, and CSS and **D3.js** is a JavaScript library for that. Browsing through the [examples provided](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery), it was pretty obvious that any one of those widgets in either Hierarchies or Networks category would serve the purpose. In fact, there was a widget named *Phylogenetic tree* which was very tempting to try. But since there will be reticulations, the trees seemed not the optimal solution.

I looked into the options in network category. The force-directed graph seemed pretty similar to what I have seen in [**Who is Who in Phylogenetic Networks**](https://phylnet.univ-mlv.fr/keywords.php#authorsandkeywords).  This could be useful of there are many nodes with multiple incoming and outgoing edges, but the academic network is generally going to be linear. I instead chose Mobile Patent Suits (MPS). 

First, the collected data must be formatted in a way that the chosen widget can read. The MPS widget required as ``.csv`` file with three columns: 1) source, 2) target, and 3) type. So an arrow would start at the source node and end at target node. Each type will have different colors. This is my final  <a href="/photograph/suits@5.csv" target="_blank">input file</a>.

This input file then replaced what was already uploaded in the example code. 

```
links = d3.csvParse(await FileAttachment("FILENAME.csv").text())
```

Finally, because the size of the network become much larger than what it originally was, I manually changed the size of the final product.

```
height = 1700
```
