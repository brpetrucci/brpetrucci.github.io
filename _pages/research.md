I am interested in a broad array of questions spanning phylogenetics, systematics, paleontology, and macroevolution.
The unifying theme of my research is developing, testing, improving, and applying computational methods leveraging fossil data in phylogenetics.
I am fascinated by what the past can tell us about the complex patterns that generated the astounding biodiversity around us, and how we can better use the methods and data in our disposal to learn about these patterns.
While most of my research has focused on phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM), I've recently become quite interested in methods of phylogenetic inference, especially those combining morphological and molecular data.
I'm question-oriented, and haven't hitched my wagon to any particular group in the past.
I have recently enjoyed delving deep into the systematics of Canidae, however, and hope to contribute much to our knowledge on this cuddly and fascinating group in the coming years.

# Integrating fossils into phylogenetic methods

The vast majority of the uncountable species that have called Earth home have gone extinct.
A very, very small percentage of those left remains that paleontologists can find, identify, and make available for the rest of us to study.
These fossils represent the only direct data on the past of life on Earth, and... little intro
