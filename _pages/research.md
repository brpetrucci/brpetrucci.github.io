### Inferring phylogenetic networks and hybridization

Reconstructing the 'tree of life' is the central goal in phylogenetics, however, the true relationship of taxa can never be inferred unless reticulate processes, such as hybridization, are taken into account. The network inference methods available today are largely categorized by their purposes, either to exhibit conflicting signals within data (i.e., abstract networks) or to model reticulate evolution (i.e., explicit networks), although the distinction often is vague in practice. It must be stressed that the former does not narrate evolutionary histories whereas the latter does, while being rarely used in practice due to excessive computational requirements. Because network inference using the explicit methods is NP-hard, only one or two individuals per subpopulation are included in the analysis which can result in insufficient signal to infer a relationship that is representative of the entire population. The objective for this aim is to develop a computational tool that infers phylogenetic networks with hybrid speciation using multi-locus data from multiple individuals per population with a feasible computational cost.
