## Summary <a href="/cv/cv.pdf" target="popup">[cv]</a>

<div>
<p><a href="https://eeob.osu.edu/people/kong.362">I am a Ph.D. Candidate</a> at <a href="https://eeob.osu.edu">the Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu">the Ohio State University</a> under supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kubatko.2/">Laura Kubatko</a> from fall 2018. I am interested in methods for inferring phylogenetic networks and hybrid speciation under the coalescent model.</p>
<p>I studied in <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, Canada and conferred B.Sc. and M.Sc. I focused on evolutionary biology (phylogenetics and networks) and herpetology (Indochina green pitvipers; genus <i>Trimeresurus</i>) under supervision of Professor <a href="http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/murphy/Starter.html">Robert Murphy</a>, senior curator at the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation Biology at the <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en">Royal Ontario Museum</a>; professor at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> and Chinese Academy of Sciences. Also, under supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/people/d-faculty/Mclennan.htm">Deborah McLennan</a>, I investigated the evolution of infanticidal behavior in primates in macroevolutionary framework focusing on the sexual selection hypothesis. I spent many years with <a href="http://ericdavies.ca">Eric Davies</a> at Urban Biodiversity and Forestry Laboratory as a Biodiversity Technician. These experiences allowed me to explore biology in more philosophical perspectives. Before I move to Columbus, I worked as a researcher at <a href="http://www.ewha.ac.kr">Ewha Womans University</a> in Seoul, South Korea, with Professor Yikweon Jang and Professor <a href="https://mcz.harvard.edu/people/jae-chun-choe">Jae Chun Choe.</a></p>

## Research 

### Inferring phylogenetic networks and hybridization

Reconstructing the 'tree of life' is the central goal in phylogenetics, however, the true relationship of taxa can never be inferred unless reticulate processes, such as hybridization, are taken into account. The network inference methods available today are largely categorized by their purposes, either to exhibit conflicting signals within data (i.e., abstract networks) or to model reticulate evolution (i.e., explicit networks), although the distinction often is vague in practice. It must be stressed that the former does not narrate evolutionary histories whereas the latter does, while being rarely used in practice due to excessive computational requirements. Because network inference using the explicit methods is NP-hard, only one or two individuals per subpopulation are included in the analysis which can result in insufficient signal to infer a relationship that is representative of the entire population. The objective for this aim is to develop a computational tool that infers phylogenetic networks with hybrid speciation using multi-locus data from multiple individuals per population with a feasible computational cost.

</p></center>

<p>I bicycled through rural China for more than a thousand kilometers (from Shandong province to Guangdong province) until my bike broke in suburban Shenzhen. I motor-biked into the mountains of Vietnam, following the Ho Chi Minh trail, where the remnants of the war were still noticeable. I volunteered in an elementary school in Thailand, the Primate Research Center in Indonesia and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Laos.Kuang.Si.Butterflypark/">Kuang Si Butterflypark</a>&nbsp;(my paradise) in Laos. Myanmar is one of the countries where I have the best memories, but the ongoing violent clashes between Shan and Palaung tribes in Shan province frightened me, the tension there was significantly higher than in Pakistan or Xinjiang, China. Riding the days-long overcrowded trains in India and China was physically and mentally challenging, but the outcomes of those challenges, like trekking in the Himalayas, are some of my most precious memories.</p>
