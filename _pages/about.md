<p>I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in <a href="https://ece.ucsd.edu">the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://ucsd.edu">the University of California, San Diego</a>. I work with Drs.  <a href="http://eceweb.ucsd.edu/~smirarab/">Siavash Mirarab</a> and  <a href="http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/vbafna/">Vineet Bafna</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://eeob.osu.edu">Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu">the Ohio State University</a> advised by <a href="https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kubatko.2/">Laura Kubatko</a>, in 2023. I studied methods for inferring phylogenetic networks and hybrid speciation under the coalescent model. I conferred B.Sc. and M.Sc. at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, Canada, where I studied evolutionary biology and herpetology, advised by Dr. Robert Murphy. I also studied the evolution of Primate behavior with Dr. Deborah McLennan. I spent many years with <a href="http://ericdavies.ca">Eric Davies</a> at Urban Biodiversity and Forestry Laboratory as a Biodiversity Technician. Moreover, I worked as a researcher at <a href="http://www.ewha.ac.kr">Ewha Womans University</a> in Seoul, South Korea, with Drs. Yikweon Jang and Jae Chun Choe.</p>
