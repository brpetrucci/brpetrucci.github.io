<p>I am a semester postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu">The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM)</a> at <a href="https://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a> for fall 2024. I was a postdoctoral research associate in <a href="https://solislemuslab.github.io">the Solis-Lemus Lab</a> at <a href="https://wid.wisc.edu">the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery</a> at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu">the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://eeob.osu.edu">Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu">the Ohio State University</a> advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kubatko.2/">Laura Kubatko</a>, in 2023. I am interested in developing and understanding methods for inferring phylogenetic networks and hybrid speciation using genomic data under the coalescent model.</p> 

<p>I conferred B.Sc. and M.Sc. at <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, Canada, where I studied evolutionary biology and phylogenetics, advised by Dr. Robert Murphy. I also studied the evolution of Primate behavior with Dr. Deborah McLennan. I spent many years with <a href="http://ericdavies.ca">Eric Davies</a> at Urban Biodiversity and Forestry Laboratory as a Biodiversity Technician. Moreover, I worked as a researcher at <a href="http://www.ewha.ac.kr">Ewha Womans University</a> in Seoul, South Korea, with Drs. Yikweon Jang and Jae Chun Choe.</p>
