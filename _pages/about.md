<p>I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/">Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB)</a> department at <a href="https://iastate.edu">Iowa State University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://phyloworks.org">Tracy Heath</a>. 
My research centers around the integration of fossils into phylogenetic methods, both in the realm of tree inference and phylogenetic comparative methods. 
I received by B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, with an honors thesis advised by Prof. <a href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/michael-foote/">Michael Foote</a>.
I also worked for a summer in the <a href="https://labmeme.github.io/aboutme/">Macroevolution and Macroecology Lab (LabMeMe)</a> at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/">University of SÃ¢o Paulo</a>, under Prof. Dr. Tiago Bosisio Quental, where the work that eventually became my honors thesis began.
